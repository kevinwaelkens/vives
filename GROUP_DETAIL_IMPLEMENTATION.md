# Group Detail Page Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive group detail page that allows tutors to manage their assigned classes with full CRUD operations for students and tasks. The implementation includes proper permission controls to ensure tutors can only access and manage groups they are assigned to.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Group Detail API Endpoints**

#### `/api/groups/[id]` - Group Management
- **GET**: Retrieve detailed group information including:
  - Group basic info (name, code, academic year, grade)
  - Assigned tutors
  - All students in the group with parent contacts and statistics
  - Recent tasks (latest 10)
  - Student and task counts
- **PATCH**: Update group information (tutors can only update groups they're assigned to)
- **DELETE**: Delete group (Admin only, with validation for existing students/tasks)

#### `/api/groups/[id]/students` - Student Management
- **POST**: Move student to the group (with proper permission validation)
- **DELETE**: Remove student from group (Admin only, with cascade deletion)

### 2. **Group Detail Page UI**

#### **Header Section**
- Group name, code, academic year, and grade display
- Back navigation to groups list
- Edit group button with modal form

#### **Overview Cards**
- Total Students count
- Active Tasks count  
- Assigned Tutors with names

#### **Students Management Section**
- Grid view of all students in the group
- Student cards showing:
  - Name and student ID
  - Email and primary parent contact
  - Assessment and attendance counts
  - Individual edit and remove actions
- **Move Student Dialog**: Transfer students between groups
- **Add Student Button**: Navigate to student creation
- **Remove Student**: Permanent deletion with confirmation

#### **Tasks Section**
- Recent tasks display (latest 10)
- Task cards showing:
  - Title, description, and type
  - Due date and submission counts
  - Edit task button
- **Create Task Button**: Navigate to task creation
- **View All Tasks**: Navigate to filtered task list

### 3. **Permission System**

#### **Tutor Restrictions**
- ✅ Can only view groups they are assigned to
- ✅ Can only edit groups they are assigned to
- ✅ Can only move students between their assigned groups
- ✅ Cannot remove themselves from group assignments
- ✅ Cannot assign new tutors (only admins can)

#### **Admin Privileges**
- ✅ Full access to all groups
- ✅ Can assign/remove tutors
- ✅ Can delete groups (with validation)
- ✅ Can permanently remove students

### 4. **Enhanced Groups List Page**

#### **Navigation Improvements**
- Added "View Details" button (eye icon) for each group
- Made group cards clickable to navigate to detail page
- Proper event handling to prevent conflicts with action buttons

### 5. **API Client Updates**

#### **Extended Groups API**
```typescript
// New methods added to groupsApi
getGroup(id: string): Promise<GroupWithRelations>
moveStudentToGroup(groupId: string, studentId: string): Promise<void>
removeStudentFromGroup(groupId: string, studentId: string): Promise<void>
```

### 6. **Internationalization**

#### **Translation Keys Added**
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "edit_group": "Edit Group",
    "total_students": "Total Students",
    "active_tasks": "Active Tasks",
    "tutors": "Tutors",
    "students": "Students",
    "recent_tasks": "Recent Tasks",
    "move_student": "Move Student",
    "add_student": "Add Student",
    "remove_student": "Remove Student",
    "create_task": "Create Task",
    "view_all_tasks": "View All Tasks",
    "no_students": "No students in this group yet.",
    "no_tasks": "No tasks created for this group yet.",
    "move_student_dialog": {
      "title": "Move Student to Another Group",
      "select_student": "Select Student",
      "target_group": "Target Group"
    },
    "remove_student_dialog": {
      "title": "Remove Student",
      "description": "Are you sure you want to remove {name} from this group?"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Implementation

### **Database-Level Security**
- All queries include proper WHERE clauses filtering by tutor assignments
- Permission validation before any write operations
- Audit logging for all group and student modifications

### **API Validation**
- Tutor permission checks on all endpoints
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access
- Input validation using Zod schemas

### **Frontend Protection**
- UI elements conditionally rendered based on user role
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Navigation guards for unauthorized access

## Usage Examples

### **For Tutors**
1. Navigate to `/groups` to see assigned groups
2. Click on a group card or "View Details" to access `/groups/[id]`
3. View all students and their information
4. Move students between assigned groups
5. Create new tasks for the group
6. Edit group information (name, code, etc.)

### **For Admins**
- Same as tutors, plus:
- Access to all groups regardless of assignment
- Ability to permanently remove students
- Ability to delete groups
- Full tutor assignment management

## File Structure

```
src/app/api/groups/
├── [id]/
│   ├── route.ts                 # Group CRUD operations
│   └── students/
│       └── route.ts             # Student management within groups

src/app/(dashboard)/groups/

lib/i18n/locales/en/
└── groups.json                  # Translation keys
```

## Testing Recommendations

To test the group detail functionality:

1. **Login as a tutor** and verify:
   - Can only see assigned groups
   - Can view group details for assigned groups
   - Cannot access unassigned groups (404/403)
   - Can move students between assigned groups only

2. **Login as admin** and verify:
   - Can access all groups
   - Can manage tutors and students
   - Can delete groups (with proper validation)

3. **Test permission boundaries**:
   - Try accessing `/groups/[unassigned-group-id]` as tutor
   - Try moving students to unassigned groups
   - Verify audit logs are created for all operations

## Next Steps

The group detail page is now fully functional with comprehensive student and task management capabilities. The implementation maintains security best practices and provides an intuitive user experience for both tutors and administrators.

Key benefits:
- ✅ **Secure**: Proper permission controls at all levels
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Intuitive interface with clear navigation
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Full CRUD operations for group management
- ✅ **Scalable**: Modular design that can be extended
- ✅ **Accessible**: Proper error handling and user feedback
